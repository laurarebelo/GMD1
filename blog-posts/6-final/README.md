Hello and welcome to my final blog post about OverChrome, my GMD baby!!!

This is a game that set out to make the most out of the Input options given - the VIA Arcade machine, featuring, per player, one joystick, four colored buttons and two black and white buttons.

The buttons provided were:
- Red
- Green
- Blue

Which made for a lot of nice saturated color combinations!

In OverChrome, you must kill your enemies by spraying them with the paint that is the opposite color of what they are made of. So if your enemy is Blue, you must spray it with Yellow (R+G), and if it is yellow, you must spray it with Blue! Not to be mistaken with Cyan, of course.

As soon as you open the game, you are greeted by an infinite-side-scrolling screen of a sewer with a striking Title (OVERHCROME) that changes color as you press the colored inputs. This is an easter egg! :)

Upon pressing play, you will be greeted by a cutscene where you find out that you, the player, are a grafitti artist. Amidst your craft, you meet Maggie, a cute girl dressed entirely in Magenta who tells you that the city's sewers are filled with paint monsters and that only you can kill them with your spray paint!!! She begs... And she's pretty, and you don't have a life, so you say yes!

You are then taken to a tutorial where you learn first-hand how to handle these monsters!

It is then your challenge to finish three levels where you must kill all the colored monsters with what you have learned. It might be more challenging than you think, because spraying them with the wrong color will not work! So you must stay sharp at all times.

If at any point you are in doubt as to what colors to press to spray a certain output, you can always Pause the game and check the Options menu!

At the end of the game, there is another cutscene with Maggie where she thanks you for the huge favor you have done to the city. And maybe you are off to a lovely friendship...! Who knows what will happen off screen.

The last screen of the game is me thanking you for playing!
